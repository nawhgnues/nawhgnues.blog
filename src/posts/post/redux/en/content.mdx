Since Recoil, which I had primarily used until now, declared the end of development on January 12, 2025, I'm considering switching to another state management library. In this process, I decided to review Redux, which I studied previously.

### Main Concepts of Redux

- Store: The place where the state is stored.
- Action: Changes the state of the Store.
- Reducer: Takes the current state and the action object to return a new state.
- Dispatch: Passes the action object to update the state.
- Subscribe: Calls the functions or objects that are subscribed when the state changes.

### Using Redux

#### 1.Creating the Store

```js
import { legacy_createStore as createStore } from "redux";

const INCREASE = "INCREASE";
const DECREMENT = "DECREMENT";

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
  id: Date.now(),
};

// Create the reducer
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  // Determine which action occurred.
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREASE:
      return {
        ...state,
        value: state.value + 1,
      };
    case DECREMENT:
      return {
        ...state,
        value: state.value - 1,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(reducer);
export { store, INCREASE, DECREMENT };
```

#### 2. Using the Store

```js
// Wrapping the App component with Provider to supply the Redux Store to the entire React app
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store";

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>;
```

```js
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { INCREASE, DECREMENT } from "./store";

const increase = () => ({ type: INCREASE });
const decrement = () => ({ type: DECREMENT });

const App = () => {
  // Fetch the state stored in the Store
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.value);

  // Get the dispatch function
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increase())}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Using Redux Toolkit

There were issues with long boilerplate code in Redux and the rule of not directly modifying existing objects, which could be inconvenient. To address these issues, Redux Toolkit was introduced.

#### 1. Creating a createSlice

```js
// counterReducer.ts
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: {
    value: 0,
    id: Date.now(),
  },
  reducers: {
    increase: (state) => {
      state.value = state.value + 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value = state.value - 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increase, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

#### 2. Creating the Store with configureStore

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterReducer";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: counterReducer,
});
```

#### 3. Updating the Store State

```js
import React from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { increase, decrement } from "./counter/countSlice";

export default function App() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increase())}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Summary

The state management flow in Redux, from `Action → Reducer → Store → Dispatch`, feels clear and consistent.

For this reason, I think it has good predictability and maintainability, especially in large-scale services where state management is complex.

However, due to the long boilerplate code, for simpler projects, I personally prefer using Zustand.
