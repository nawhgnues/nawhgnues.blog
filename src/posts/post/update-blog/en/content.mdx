### Why I decided to create my own blog

Using a pre-built blog template is a quick and easy way to create a blog, but there were a few times when I wanted to change the design or add features that I needed.

So this time, I decided to create my own blog, customizing it to my liking.


### Technology stack used

#### 1. Framework : [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

I think this is the hottest framework for frontend right now.
It seems to have a lot of advantages, such as SSR support and good SEO.

#### 2. Design : [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

I think this library is also a hot design library right now.
It is a library that makes you realize that naming each class was a bigger effort than you thought.

In addition to tailwindcss, I used shadcn, a headless component lib.
It is styled based on tailwindcss and is highly customizable.

#### 3. Posting : [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

I wrote the post as an mdx file and saved it in the internal directory of the project.
I used MDX, which can use JSX syntax in addition to basic MD.

#### 4. Parsing : [Gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) + [Next-MDX-Remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support)

We parsed the meta information and body content of the created mdx file.
It shows the list of posts based on the parsed information.

gray-matter : parsed post title, description, date, and thumbnail
next-mdx-remote : remark, rehype the post body in html format

#### 6. Deploy : [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard)

Vercel is a cloud platform used to deploy and manage static websites and serverless functions.
Next.js is a framework created by vercel, so it is highly compatible.

If you link the github repository, your CI/CD pipeline will be done automatically.
You can also purchase your own domain address and connect it right away, and it also provides a page analysis statistics tool.
